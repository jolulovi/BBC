Software tools, languages and scripts :
Eclipse Neon.2 Release (4.6.2)
Apache
Javascript
HTML,CSS

SIgnificance of scripts/software:
The application is designed to be run locally, but scripts are linked to external servers in the implementation code.

Data:
The data is acquired after click events triggered by the user by selecting a candidate.

Data files:
votemain.html
style.css
count.js

Installation:
The application requires a local server to interact with user interface. Links to libraries used in the application are in the header of the html document.
All the files must also be placed locally.

Analysis of application:
I firstly started building a java application, but the processing time was above the 1 second requirement, therefore I decided to think about another technology on which I could improve the speed. 
I made an  improvement to a small application in a previous role where I implemented one of the new features of HTML5 (localStorage). I rapidly realised that using javascript, I could stored the information locally and increased the speed of the counting.
I am fully aware that in order to implement a software to produce a robust voting system.  All the data inserted by the user (personal info) and voting selections needed to be stored in a server solution and make requests to access data and save it.
